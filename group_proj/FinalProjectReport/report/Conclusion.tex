\section{Conclusion}
[Summarize]
Conclusion: Write a conclusion and future work for your project

Here you summarize the essential aspects and findings 
of your work and analysis.

We found that the best performing algorithm was ...
It had the highest accuracy and the least amount of over/underfitting.

\section{Future Work}
[What improvements could be done]

Increase dataset size and diversity
A larger dataset may allow CNN models to achieve learning stability, increasing overall performance
This would particularly be useful while applying the VGG16 model, as it is more computationally expansive and was pretrained on larger datasets
For CNN models built from scratch, more layers, filters, and neurons may need to be added to increase complexity, ensuring that the intricate features and patterns of the images were captured
Stricter set of criteria for clean images
Additional augmentations of images
For SVM, use a smaller subset of the data to perform training
