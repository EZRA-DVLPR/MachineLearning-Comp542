\section{Conclusion}
[Summarize]
Conclusion: Write a conclusion and future work for your project

Here you summarize the essential aspects and findings 
of your work and analysis.

We found that the best performing algorithm was ...
It had the highest accuracy and the least amount of over/underfitting.

\section{Future Work}

Some improvements that can be done on our project would be to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Increase dataset size and diversity of images
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A larger dataset may allow CNN models to achieve learning stability, increasing overall performance
        \item This would particularly be useful while applying the VGG16 model, as it is more computationally expansive and was pretrained on larger datasets
    \end{itemize}
    \item For CNN models built from scratch, more layers, filters, and neurons may need to be added to increase complexity, ensuring that the intricate features and patterns of the images were captured
    \item Stricter set of criteria for clean images
    \item Additional augmentations of images
    \item For SVM, use a smaller subset of the data to perform training faster
\end{itemize}
