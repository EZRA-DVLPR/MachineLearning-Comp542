# comp_542_proj

A collection of assignments and the group project for my Machine Learning Class at CSUN Fall 2023

# Explanations of each folder:

## assignment1

A single document in pdf format discussing the differences between the various Disciplines of AI, ML, DL, etc.

## assignment2

A short assignment to learn the basics of ML with the well-known iris dataset from UCI - Iris

`assignment2.ipynb` contians all the code for this section

all other files are for the dataset

## assignment3

A short assignment to use linear SVM and kernel RBF SVM Classifier on MNIST dataset.

`assignment3.ipynb` contains all the code for this assignment

## Midterm 2 Code Portion

Code to perform the Coding Portion of the 2nd Midterm for the class:

`ANN_MNIST.ipynb` was the given code

`ANN_MNIST_MODIFIED.ipynb` contains the adjustments made to the given document to run on my computer

`data.csv` contains the given dataset from the professor

`IsaiahMartinezMidterm2.ipynb` was my code submission with output cells for the 2nd Midterm


## group_proj

A group project where me and my groupmate are working on the same dataset and problem, but are working with different algorithms.
Isaiah will work with SVM, Res Net 50, and CLIP while Joycelyn will work with CNN and VGG16
Together we are doing a Image Classification on Cats, Dogs & Pandas.

Our dataset can be seen [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishsaxena2209/animal-image-datasetdog-cat-and-panda)

`project.ipynb` is the notebook that we used to work on the project

`projHelper.py` is a helper file that we used to create and store functions that would be useful

`vgg16_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_notop.h5` contains the weights to be used for VGG16

`/animals` contains the original given images from the dataset selected

`/animals_cleaned` contains the images that were deemed usable for working

`/animals_cleaned_GS` are the images within animals_cleaned after being resized and put through a GrayScale filter

`/finalProjectReport` contains all of the LaTeX files that were necessary for the final report including the final report itself

`/papers` contains the related works used for a separate assignment that was related to this project

`/presentation` contains the powerpoint presentations in .pptx and pdf format for our project

`/proposal` contains the project proposal and its revision in pdf format

`/relatedWorksIsaiah` contains some the related works Isaiah Martinez used for the project. This was used for another separate but related assignment

`citations.txt` is a txt file that contains some sample documents to be used for the final project that would be cited

`imgsRemoved.txt` is a txt file that contains the images that were removed via manual cleaning

`notes.txt` is a txt file that contains some sample notes that we shared between us to outline the data clearly

Please see:
